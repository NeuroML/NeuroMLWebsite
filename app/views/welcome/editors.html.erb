            <p>An elected board of editors has been formed to manage the NeuroML specification development process. The editors are 
                responsible for producing and maintaining the official documentation for the NeuroML language. Due to the close link between 
                the development of NeuroML 2 and LEMS, this group is also responsible for producing a stable specification for the 
                subset of LEMS used by NeuroML 2.</p>

            <p>The five current members of the NeuroML Editorial Board are: <b>Justas Birgiolas</b>, <b>Andrew Davison</b>, <b>Salvador Dura-Bernal</b>, <b>Padraig Gleeson</b> and <b>Boris Marin</b>. 
                Andrew Davison and Salvador Dura-Bernal were elected for three year terms 2019 - 2021 and Padraig Gleeson, Boris Marin and Justas Birgiolas were elected for three year terms 2020 - 2022.</p>

                            <h2>Procedures</h2>

                            <p>The procedures for election of the editorial board, its responsibilities, size and activities were heavily inspired by other
                                initiatives like <a href="http://sbml.org/Documents/SBML_Development_Process#The_SBML_Editors">SBML</a>, that have had 
                                successful editorial teams for many years. The <a href="http://co.mbine.org/standards">COMBINE initiative</a> seeks to 
                                promote community developed standards in computational biology, and the NeuroML editorial board will work with this 
                                initiative to ensure best practices in specification preparation.</p>

                            <h2>Responsibilities of the NeuroML Editors</h2>

                            <p>The editorial board consists of five members, elected by the NeuroML community. The main responsibilities are:</p>

                            <ul class="bluebullets">
                                <li>Defining and documenting the procedure for specification production: scope, release frequency, update procedures, 
                                    form of specification (web based or single pdf, etc.). This should be based on some or all of the recommendations for
                                    community based standards development from the <a href="http://co.mbine.org/standards">COMBINE initiative</a>. These
                                    procedures for specification production will have to be agreed with the <a href='scientific_committee'>NeuroML Scientific Committee</a>.</li>
        
                                <li>Preparing the core specification for the NeuroML language.</li>

                                <li>Testing reference implementations of NeuroML compliant applications.</li>

                                <li>Preparing a specification for the LEMS language. This can be a subset of the language supported by the reference 
                                    implementations in Java (<a href="http://github.com/LEMS/jLEMS/">jLEMS</a>) and Python 
                                    (<a href="https://github.com/LEMS/pylems">PyLEMS</a>), but will have to cover all of the LEMS elements required to 
                                    specify the <a href="http://www.neuroml.org/NeuroML2CoreTypes/Cells.html">ComponentType definitions for NeuroML 2</a>.</li>

                                <li>Responding to community queries about the specification.</li>

                                <li>Establishing a procedure for incorporating major changes into the specification (in cooperation with the 
                                    <a href='scientific_committee'>NeuroML Scientific Committee</a>).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <br />

                            <p>Participation in the editorial board will be on a volunteer basis, there is no central funding to support this work.</p>
